Travel Log app using MERN stack.

-set up server and dependencies

-set up express and middleware

-installed Mongoose, created models (Log Entry). I used mongoose because MongoDB doesnt have schemas

-created schema with mongoose

-created GET, GET by ID, POST, and DELETE endpoint routes for the Express API and tested in Postman
